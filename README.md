## Installation

Add lita-aws to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'lita-aws'
```

## System requirement

1. [AWS-CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) must be installed, make sure your lita user can execute `aws`.


## Configuration

- lita-aws support multiple aws accounts, configurating through aws-cli, you can use following commands to manage aws accounts.


#### List saved accounts

```
(lita) aws profile
```

#### Create or update account.

```
(lita) aws profile [profile_name] [region] [api_key] [secret_key]
```

- profile_name: Only accept lower letter and numbers. `default` will set to aws-cli default profile.
- region: AWS region, such as: `ap-northeast-1`
- api_key: AWS access key id.
- secret_key: AWS secret access key.

Example:

```
(lita) aws profile 5fpro ap-northeast-1 abcdefg ababcdcd
```

## Usage

#### Get AWS account number.

```
# with default profile
(lita) aws account-id
# with specific profile
(lita) aws account-id --profile {profile_name}
# Example:
(lita) aws account-id --profile 5fpro
```

# Execute as aws-cli

```
(lita) aws-cli ec2 describe-instances --page-size 10 --profile {profile_name}
```

That will execute as command line:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --page-size 10 --profile {profile_name}
```

and return json.

```
(lita) aws ec2-memutil {Instance ID} --ago 2d --cal Average --period 300s --profile {profile_name}
